      <p>I was introduced to Pet Partners through an invitation to visit the Lapan College club. The Lapan College club helps at risk kids graduate high school and prepare for college. One of the services they provide is therapy animals. It was an amazing visit.<br><br>

        I watched the as the animals seemed to change the children's state of mind like some magic shaman waving a wand. It was a beautiful experience. Upon further investigation, I discovered that Pet Partners has a variety of great programs that bring animals to people with all types of needs.<br><br>
        
        I instantaneously wanted to be a part of this wonderful work. A week or so later they asked me to serve on the board. There was some slight hesitation in my immediate answer. YES.<br><br>
