      <p>Darren and I were passengers in a car, stopped at a traffic light when we were struck from behind.  The driver had been texting while driving, and never stopped.  We both suffered severe whiplash, which required many months of treatments and therapy.  We made the poor choice of hiring the same attorney that the driver of our car hired, because “it seemed like the easy thing to do”.  The attorney, Michelle, was horrible.  She was billing us for hours she never worked on our case.  Many months went by and nothing was done.  We reached out to the State of Arizona for help.  They investigated the matter and issued disciplinary action against her.  She then waived her bill.  We still had no resolution on the case.  After hearing our crazy story, our friend and client, Matt, who is also a lawyer, referred us to Brian Marchetti.  Brian was a breath of fresh air.  He restored my faith instantly, upon speaking with him.  He took the case and within a very short period of time, we both received checks to help us pay for some of our bills.  He understands the law and how to negotiate.  A few months after the first checks arrived, we settled and received a fair amount of money.  It was like night and day.  If you are ever looking for an injury lawyer, Brian is hands down the best.  Make sure to tell him that Tony Ray and Darren referred you!
