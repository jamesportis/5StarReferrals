      <p>The first time I worked home staging with Elizabeth was when one of our clients called her to stage their
        home. The house had been on the market for six months, with only a few showings.<br><br>

    Mind you, this is a half a million-dollar listing on Swan Road, a busy thorough fair.  The client was
        referred to both us and Elizabeth by a mutual friend. Elizabeth staged the house beautifully. We sent
        out our professional photographer to enable us to prepare the marketing.  <br><br>

    We listed the home on Friday, had four offers by Sunday and it was sold by Monday morning! Her staging
        gave us everything we needed to create stunning marketing and advertising.  <br><br>

    Not to worry, if you’re not selling your home, but it needs a face lift, Elizabeth can help you redesign
        and redecorate your current space, utilizing your own furnishings and artwork.<br><br>
