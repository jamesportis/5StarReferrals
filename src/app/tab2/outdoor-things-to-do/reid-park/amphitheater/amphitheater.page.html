      <p>This outdoor theatre is a fantastic music venue. The acoustics are enjoyable. You can hear the entertainment from the stage, while still being able to hear your partner speak. Get there early, because it is a very popular event. A beautiful, cooler evening, sitting back in your chair or beach towel or blanket. There are a few bleachers, but they get swooped up quickly. Listening to a concert, under the beautiful stars of Tucson. It doesnâ€™t get any better than that.<br><br>
